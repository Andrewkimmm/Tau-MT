# Characterization of Phosphorylated Tau-Microtubule complex with Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation

EMMI Protocol.odt has the commands for cryo-EM MetaInference simulation
Classical_protocol.odt has the commands for classical simulation used in the study

em_emmi.mdp, npt_emmi.mdp, nvt_emmi.mdp are the parameters for EMMI simulation
em.mdp, ions.mdp, npt.mdp, nvt.mdp are the parameters for classical simulation

All commands are based on GROMACS 2022.5 patched with PLUMED 2.8.3. in Linux Ubuntu 2022.4 environment
